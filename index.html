      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Located at a distance of 7 km from the center of Mainpat is a popular attraction called Tiger Point. Basically this spot has a beautiful waterfall that originates from Mahadev Muda River; this waterfall is surrounded by lush green and dense forests that make the place even more scenic. It is said that many people have spotted tigers in that area and hence the name came to be Tiger Point. Falling from a height of 60 m, the water falling from the waterfall makes a pool where several tourists sit and spend a relaxing day. This is one of the top attractions in Mainpat.</p>

  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Mainpat has a lot of natural resources, one of them being Tatapani, a natural hot water spring. This attraction is distanced at 12 km from the center of Mainpat and it has quite a history. Mythology says that during the era of Ramayan, Shri Ram during game play accidentally spilt hot oil from a bowl straight the ground. It is said that when these oil droplets fell to the ground, they made a hole so deep that hot water started to seep out of those holes. People living in Mainpat consider Tatapani to be sacred and believe that people taking a Bath in this reservoir can get rid of their diseases and sins. You can see a lot of tourists in this place during the festival of Makar Sankranti.</p>
